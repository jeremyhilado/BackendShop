It has a bright 7.9-inch display that works with the Apple Pencil and a chipset that smokes the small tablet competition. Its price is equally deceptive, costing more than the larger iPad 9.7. For its asking price, we would have loved to have seen an 'iPad Pro mini' and Apple Pencil Gen 2 support, but it’s hard not to love this charming little tab."
